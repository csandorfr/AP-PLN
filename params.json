The AP-PLN  directory contains directory src with source code of three modules and directories of python and R scripts. \r\nYou need to move next in the directory AP-PLN (cd AP-PLN). \r\nYou must then download and extract the following tar.gz file in your AP-PLN directory:\r\n\r\n* [data.tar.gz](http://wwwfgu.anat.ox.ac.uk/downloads/compbio_projects/CW016_SANDOR_AP_PLN/data.tar.gz)\r\n* [example.tar.gz](http://wwwfgu.anat.ox.ac.uk/downloads/compbio_projects/CW016_SANDOR_AP_PLN/example.tar.gz)\r\n* [example_t2d.tar.gz](http://wwwfgu.anat.ox.ac.uk/downloads/compbio_projects/CW016_SANDOR_AP_PLN/example_t2d.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nFinally, you must configure a environment variable, named $AP_PLN_HOME by this way: export AP_PLN_HOME=directory of AP_PLN\r\n\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nAP-PLN is divided into tree modules, consisting to:\r\n\r\n* design a specific phenotypic benchmark according to a list of mouse phenotype term selected by the user \r\n* evaluate and re-scale automatically genomic functional datasets on a phenotypic benchmark. \r\n* integrate multiple functional genomic dataset previously re-scaled on a unique phenotypic benchmark. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Quick Start\r\n\r\nYou are now ready to use AP-PLN !\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
