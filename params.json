The AP-PLN  directory contains directory src with source code of three modules and directories of python and R scripts. \r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nAP-PLN is divided into tree modules, consisting to:\r\n\r\n * design a specific phenotypic benchmark according to a list of mouse phenotype term selected by the user \r\n * evaluate and re-scale automatically genomic functional datasets on a phenotypic benchmark. \r\n * integrate multiple functional genomic dataset previously re-scaled on a unique phenotypic benchmark. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Quick Start\r\n\r\nYou are now ready to use AP-PLN !\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
