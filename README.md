### AP-PLN

AP-PLN is an automatic pipeline to design phenotypic linkage gene networks (AP-PLN) through the weighted combination of multiple functional datasets. This pipeline, is divided into three modules: the first creates a disease-specific phenotypic benchmark from a user-defined set of disease-relevant phenotype annotations, the second automates the evaluation and rescoring of each functional dataset on the phenotypic benchmark and the third combines different re-scored functional datasets into a final disease-specific phenotypic linkage network (PLN). AP-PLN also offers a visual comparison of individual functional datasets in terms of accuracy, the gene-pair coverage and a network representation for a subset of genes.


### System Requirements

Running Automatic pipeline to build phenotypic linkage network (AP-PLN) requires at least Python (Python version 2.7.6) and R (R version 3.1.2). The following Python package must be installed: numpy (numpy version 1.9.1). The following R packages must be installed: earth (> 4.3.3), igraph (1.1.2) and biomaRt (2.30.0). As no compilation is required, the pipeline can be used on any computer, where Python and R are installed and it is therefore available for Windows, Linux, and MAC OS machines.

### AP-PLN - Download 

Using the buttons at the top of this page, download the ZIP file or the TAR ball, unzip/extract the download, and save the whole AP-PLN directory (folder) in your favorite directory.

The AP-PLN directory contains:
* A directory src with the source code of three modules and directories of python and R scripts. 
* A user manual in pdf format.  

The user must refer to the manual, which includes the installation instructions and a tutorial.
